# COVID19-Tracker
JSON parser to track COVID-19's global growth

As of now, it takes the current list of infected countries and includes confirmed cases, deaths reported, and recovered cases. At the end of it's run, it will compile a global stat list.

TO DO:
- Implement a JSON export of the current snapshot to compare with a previous snapshot to track the trend.
- Possibly provide a user interface to allow country-specific filters
- Hourly/Daily CSV export to track regional/global growth.
